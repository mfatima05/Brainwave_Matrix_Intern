# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern
In this internship I have created a python based phishing link scanner that identifies and flags malicious and safe links, providing users with a safer online experience.
Also a python based password strength checker that evaluates the strength of passwords, helping users create more secure and resilient credentials for a safer online experience.
