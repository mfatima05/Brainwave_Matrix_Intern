During this internship, I developed two Python-based tools:

1. Phishing Link Scanner: A tool designed to identify and flag malicious and safe links, ensuring a safer online experience for users.

2.Password Strength Checker: A tool that evaluates the strength of passwords, helping users create more secure and resilient credentials for enhanced online security.
